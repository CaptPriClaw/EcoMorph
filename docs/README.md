# EcoMorph ‚ôªÔ∏è

Welcome to EcoMorph, an innovative platform designed to transform waste into value.

The platform features an AI-powered suggestion engine, a points-based economy, and a vibrant marketplace.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Upload an image of a waste item and get AI-driven ideas for what it can become.
- **Gamified Points System**: Earn "EcoPoints" for contributing waste materials and participating in the community.
- **Upcycled Marketplace**: Browse and purchase unique, handcrafted products made from upcycled materials using your EcoPoints.
- **Two-Sided Platform**: Caters to both **Uploaders** (who provide raw materials) and **Upcyclers** (who create and sell products).
