# The EcoPoint System

The EcoPoint is the internal currency of the EcoMorph platform. It is designed to incentivize participation, reward positive actions, and create a vibrant, self-sustaining circular economy.

## How to Earn EcoPoints ðŸŸ¢

Users can earn EcoPoints through several key actions:

- **Signing Up**: New users receive a one-time welcome bonus of EcoPoints to get them started.
- **Submitting Waste**: When a user submits a waste item and it is approved by an admin, they are awarded points.
- **Selling a Product**: When an upcycler's product is purchased from the marketplace, they receive the full point value of that sale.

## How to Spend EcoPoints ðŸ”µ

The primary way to spend EcoPoints is by purchasing unique items from the marketplace. The price of each item is set in EcoPoints by the upcycler who created it.

## Point Values

The number of points awarded for actions is managed in the backend. Here are the current base values:

| Action                      | Point Value | Triggered By                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `SIGNUP_BONUS`              | 50 points   | A new user successfully registering.       |
| `WASTE_UPLOAD_APPROVED`     | 10 points   | An admin approving a user's waste submission. |
| `PRODUCT_SALE`              | (Variable)  | The sale of a product on the marketplace.  |
| `PRODUCT_PURCHASE`          | (Variable)  | The purchase of a product.                 |

This system ensures that users who contribute the most value to the ecosystem (either by providing materials or by creating products) are rewarded accordingly.
